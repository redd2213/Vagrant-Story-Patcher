# VSPatcher
Universal patch utility for Vagrant Story's ISO. This project was developed using the following libraries and tools:
- C++17 – Core programming language.
- SDL2 – Used for window management, event handling.
- SDL_mixer – For playing background music (MP3).
- OpenGL – For rendering graphics.
- Dear ImGui – Immediate mode GUI for rendering the patcher UI.
- Visual Studio – Used as the development environment.

# Description:
This tool allows you to easily apply PPF patches to your Vagrant Story 
(or other PS1) game files. It handles the patching process automatically 
and includes a safety backup feature.

# Key Features:
- Automatic backup creation (safeguards your original ISO)
- Simple graphical interface & music player for our nostalgic track :)

# Instructions:
1. Extract all files in this ZIP to a folder.
2. Run "VSPatcher.exe".
3. Click "Browse ISO" and select your game file (.bin, .iso, .img).
4. Click "Browse Patch" and select your patch file (.ppf).
5. Ensure "Create a Backup" is checked if you want to keep your original file.
6. Click "Apply Patch".

# Troubleshooting:
- If the app doesn't open, ensure all DLL files are in the same folder as the .exe.
- If music doesn't play, check your system volume mixer.
